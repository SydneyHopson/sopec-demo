## 📌 Notes for Team

- Keep all sections in `/src/sections/` (e.g., `Navbar.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, etc.)
- Use local logo/video assets from `/public/`
- Use Tailwind color `#0B3D02` for hunter green accents
- Stick to the page layout and menu structure
- Define content types clearly in Sanity Studio
- Firebase is for real-time features, not auth
